    "text": "2 Overview of \n\n2.1 What is ?\nAt first glance, “What is ?” may seem like a simple question, but as Zuur, Ieno, and Meesters (2009); point out, it’s not so easily answered—and I agree. Broadly defined,  is a computer language that allows users to program algorithms and use tools that others have developed. This is a fairly generalized description and could apply to the plethora of programming languages, but  stands out because it’s often defined as a powerful environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics—or more simply, a statistical programming language.\nIt was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as a free software environment for teaching, while they were colleagues at the University of Auckland in New Zealand (Vries and Meys 2012). Their goal was to create an intuitive system for statistical computing and data visualization—something that statisticians across the world could adopt with ease. Given its origins,  is exceptionally well-suited for data science, a vital field in today’s world— developed by statisticians for statisticians. In fact,  is often referred to as the “lingua franca of statistics” among statisticians and scientists.\nA more practical way to understand , however, is by looking at what it can do. As I’ve often told colleagues and friends, “ can do anything you can imagine,” and that’s hardly an exaggeration. With , you can:\n\nWrite custom functions and perform calculations\nApply nearly every available statistical technique\nGenerate everything from simple to highly complex graphs\nPerform geocomputation and geostatistics (Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow 2019)\nCreate stunning 3D visualizations (Morgan-Wall 2024)\nDevelop your own libraries of reusable functions\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant, nontrivial reasons for its widespread use is that  is free of charge, supported by a vast, active user community.\nSo Why Isn’t Everyone Using ?\nThis question is easier to answer:  has a notoriously steep learning curve. Since it relies heavily on programming, even though there are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available, none are advanced enough to fully eliminate the need for coding. But once you get the hang of , I reckon you’ll find it hard to return to any other software for statistical computing.\nFrom my own experience—and from hearing others share theirs—learning both  and statistics simultaneously can feel overwhelming, like climbing two steep hills at once. Zuur, Ieno, and Meesters (2009), also acknowledge this issue, noting that when  is taught alongside statistics, many learners tend to focus on simply getting the  code to run, and often overlooking the weightier statistical concepts behind it. I faced the same struggle when I was first introduced to .\nThat’s why this post focuses primarily on providing basic  instructions and not diving too deeply into statistics. However, I will demonstrate some fundamental statistical procedures you can perform in  later in the post. If your goal is to learn both R and statistics, this guide will provide the foundation you need to master , equipping you with the skills to explore its powerful statistical tools and the vast range of packages that extend its capabilities.\n\n\n2.2 Historical Background of \n is a modern implementation, or dialect, of an earlier programming language called S (Becker, Chambers, and Wilks 2018). It also incorporates lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme The development of  began in 1991, when Professors Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, recognized the need for a better software environment for their Macintosh teaching laboratory. Their journey into developing  is detailed in a 1996 paper in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996).\nThe name “R” is a nod to both the first names of its authors (Ross and Robert) and a playful reference to its predecessor, S. By 1993, after they had made significant progress, Ihaka and Gentleman began to share their work more widely, distributing binary copies of `{{&lt; fa brands r-project &gt;}} through the StatLib data archive and announcing it on the s-news mailing list.\nInterest in  quickly grew, and many began to collaborate with the duo—most notably, Martin Mächler from ETH Zurich. In June 1995, Mächler convinced Ihaka and Gentleman to release  as free and open-source software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License, allowing anyone to use and modify it freely. Initially, bug reports were sent via email, but as interest surged, it became clear that manually maintaining communication was unsustainable. In response, in March 1996, Mächler volunteered the facilities at ETH Zurich to set up the r-testers mailing list, which allowed for automated discussions about  and its development.\nApproximately a year later, r-testers was replaced by three newsgroups: R-announce, R-help, and R-devel. Over time, more mailing lists were added to accommodate the growing community. Currently, the  project maintains five general mailing lists, including R-package-devel and R-packages, which can be found at https://www.r-project.org/mail.html.\nToday, the R Core Team—a group of currently 18 active individuals—has write access to the  source code (https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html), guiding its ongoing development. Many others have also contributed through new code submissions and bug fixes, making R a true collaborative effort. For those interested in a more detailed account of R’s development, Ross Ihaka provides a fascinating overview, available at http:// cran.r‐project.org/doc/html/ interface98‐paper/paper.html.\nThe Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) was officially launched on 23 April 1997, providing a centralized platform to store R’s executable files, source code, documentation, and packages. Over time, CRAN has grown into one of the most extensive repositories for data science tools. In April 2003, the R Foundation was founded as a non-profit organization to provide long-term support for ’s continued development, ensuring that it remains a leading tool for statistical computing and data visualization.\nSince its humble beginnings,  has grown into a global force in statistical computing and data science. Thanks to its open-source nature and a thriving community, it remains one of the most widely used and rapidly evolving tools for data analysis. As the field of data science expands, ’s importance continues to grow, cementing its place as an indispensable resource for statisticians, data scientists, and researchers alike."

    "text": "3 Getting Started With  Programming\nEvery journey begins with gathering the right tools, and your adventure into  programming is no different. The first essential step for any  novice is setting up the environment to start coding. Essentially, you have two main options:\n\nInstall  and an IDE such as RStudio, VS Code or Positron\nRun  in a browser, for example, via RStudio Cloud.\n\nWhile installing  along with an IDE like RStudio, VS Codeor Positron requires a little more time and effort, it offers a more robust setup—allowing offline work and leveraging your computer’s CPU—I highly recommend this approach, especially for those committed to diving deep into . However, if you’re just exploring or testing the waters, running  online through platforms like RStudio Cloud may be more convenient (provided you have a reliable internet connection).\nWhichever path you choose, this post is designed to accommodate you. Whether you install  locally or use an online platform, the examples and instructions provided here will guide you seamlessly through your  programming journey.\n\n3.1 Downloading and Installing \nNow that we’ve covered an overview of  and some of its history, it’s time to get your own copy of  so you can start using it. The easiest way to do this is by downloading a precompiled binary distribution of R, which includes the base system and contributed packages, and installing it on your computer. While it’s also possible to install  from source, this is more complex and generally not necessary for most users. I recommend sticking to the precompiled binaries, which are easy to install and are available for a range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. In this guide, we’ll focus on installing R on Windows and macOS.\n\n3.1.1 Installing  on Windows\nInstalling  on Windows is a straightforward process. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n\nGo to the CRAN website: Visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://cran.r-project.org/.\nDownload R for Windows: Click on the “Download R for Windows” link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the base system: On the next page, click “base” or “Install R for the first time” to download the R executable file (e.g., R-4.x.x-win.exe).\nRun the R installer: Once downloaded, double-click the executable file to start the installation process. You may be prompted to allow the application to make changes to your device—click “Yes” to continue.\nSelect installation language: The installer will first prompt you to select the installation language. Choose your preferred language and click “OK”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense agreement: You’ll see a window with the GNU General Public License information. Simply click “Next”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the destination location: By default, R will install in C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.x.x. Unless you have a specific reason to change it, I recommend leaving this as is and clicking “Next”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect components: In the “Select Components” window, the default options should suffice for most users, so just click “Next”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStartup options: Again, leave the default startup options selected and click “Next”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Start Menu folder: The default Start Menu folder is fine, so just click “Next” here as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional tasks: The installer will ask if you’d like to create desktop shortcuts or add R to your system PATH. The default options are usually best, so leave them checked and click “Next”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin installation: After confirming all the settings, click “Next” to start the installation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete installation: Once the installation is complete, click “Finish” to close the installer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations, you’ve successfully installed  on your Windows system!\n\n\n3.1.2 Installing  on macOS\nThe installation process for macOS is very similar to that of Windows, but with a few differences in file format. Follow these steps:\n\nGo to the CRAN website: Head over to https://cran.r-project.org/.\nDownload R for macOS: Click on “Download R for macOS”.\nChoose the latest release: In the “Latest release” section, download the appropriate version of  for your macOS system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the installer: Once the download is complete, double-click the .pkg installer file to open it.\nFollow the installation prompts: Click “Continue” and proceed through the installer by following the on-screen instructions.\nComplete installation: Once the installation process finishes, click “Close” to exit the installer.\n\nYou now have  installed on your macOS system!\nWith these steps completed, you’re ready to start programming in ! Next, we’ll move on to setting up a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to enhance your experience with .\n\n\n\n3.2 Exploring IDE Options for : Elevate Your  Programming with RStudio, VS Code, or Positron\n\n3.2.1 Getting Started With the  Interface\nWhen working with , several user interfaces (UIs) are available, but every installation of  includes a basic/standard interface—sometimes called the “R Console.” While you may eventually prefer using an advanced IDE like RStudio, it’s important to familiarize yourself with this standard interface. Not only can it be helpful when using a machine without your preferred or favorite interfaces, but it also serves as a good foundation for understanding how other interfaces are organized. You may even come to appreciate and enjoy the simplicity of the standard interface.\nWhat follows is a practical guide on using the RGUI, which is the standard graphical interface for  on Windows platforms.\nOn Windows,  is typically installed in C:\\Program Files\\R, and you can access it from the Start menu under the  group. If, during installation, you selected “Create a desktop shortcut,” you’ll also have an RGUI icon on your desktop. To launch , simply double-click this icon, and you’ll be greeted by a user interface that looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen opened, the main window, labeled “R Console,” will appear. This is where you will enter and execute your  commands. You can type commands directly into the Console and see the output immediately. This is also where error messages appear, . Keep in mind, closing the Console will end your  session.\nThe main window of RGUI is the “R Console,” which automatically opens when you launch . This Console is where you enter  commands one at a time. Depending on the command, the output will be displayed in the Console, and this is also where any error messages will appear. The Console is unique and it’s the primary space for interacting with —keep in mind, closing the Console will end your  session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIsn’t  a Language?\n\n\n\nYou might hear me refer to  as if it were a person, saying things like “Tell  to do this” or “Tell  to do that.” But, of course,  can’t do anything—it’s just a language. This is simply shorthand for saying, “Instruct your computer to perform a task by writing a command in the  language in the R console.” It’s your computer, not  itself, that does the heavy lifting.\nIs this shorthand a bit imprecise and lazy? Yes. But does everyone still use it? Absolutely—because it’s convenient and saves time!\n\n\nFor new users, the easiest way to save the Console’s contents is to navigate to File → Save to file from the menu. However, note that the Console only retains the last few thousand lines written to it, so it’s wise to save important work elsewhere. You may also find it helpful to clear the Console to start fresh. To do this, simply press Ctrl + L or select Edit → Clear console from the menu.\nReady to Write Your First Program in ?\nNow that we have  installed and running, let’s dive right in by writing our first simple computer program. To do this, open  (if it’s not already open), and in the “R Console” type the following code after the &gt; prompt symbol, then press Enter:\n\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nAfter pressing Enter, you should see the following output appear in the Console, as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!—you’ve just written a computer program! A computer program is simply a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task when executed by the computer. The “Hello, World!” program is a classic way to introduce novice programmers to a new language. It serves two purposes: demonstrating the basic syntax of the language and verifying that the installation was successful, ensuring you know how to use it. In this case, the program consists of just one instruction—the command to display the text “Hello, World!” in the console. The command responsible for this is print().\nA couple of things to note about your first program:\n\n“Hello, World!” is a string: A string is a way of representing text in a computer program. In , a string must be enclosed in quotes (' ' or \" \"), which act as delimiters, signaling where the string starts and ends. The text inside the quotes—Hello, World!—is the actual string.\nprint is a function: Just like in mathematics, a function in  takes input, performs an operation, and returns output. The print function’s job is to take its input (in this case, the string \"Hello, World!\") and display it in the console in a readable format.\nCalling a function: To execute the function, you need to “call” it, which is done by following the function name (print) with a pair of parentheses. The input to the function, in this case, the string, goes inside the parentheses. The parentheses are important as they tell  where the input starts and ends, serving as another type of delimiter.\n\nLet’s try another simple program with a basic arithmetic calculation—yes,  can function like a calculator. You can:\n\nAdd numbers with +\nSubtract with -\nMultiply with *\nDivide with /\nRaise numbers to a power with ^\n\nType the following code into the console and press Enter:\n\nprint(4 + 2)\n\nAfter pressing Enter, you should see the following output in the console:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, we’ve been using the print() function to display output. However, you can actually get output in the console without explicitly calling print(). You don’t always need the print() function for simple outputs. Typing just the expression will display the result:. For example, suppose you type:\n\n\"Hello, World!\"\n\nIn the console, you’ll see the following result:\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can try:\n\n2 + 2\n\nwith the output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRead-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL)\n\n\n\nSo far, you’ve been using  in what computer scientists call interactive mode. This means you type a command into the console, R immediately reads it, evaluates it, and prints the result back to the console for you to see. Then, you type the next command, and the process repeats. This cycle is known as the Read-Evaluate-Print Loop, or REPL for short.\n, like other interactive languages, excels at providing immediate feedback, which makes it especially useful for statisticians and data analysts who often run small procedures, check results, and refine their approach iteratively—after all, R was originally designed by statisticians, for statisticians. As beginners, the REPL offers a fantastic way to observe ’s behavior and receive instant feedback on the simple programs we’re writing, helping us quickly understand how R processes our commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhen Do We Compile?\n\n\n\nIn some languages, like C, Java, or FORTRAN, you need to compile your human-readable code into machine-readable code (typically in the form of 1s and 0s) before it can be executed. If you’ve worked with those languages before, you might wonder whether you need to compile your  code too. The answer is no—R is a dynamic programming language, meaning it automatically interprets your code on the fly as you run it, without the need for a separate compilation step.\n\n\nThe “R Editor” Window:\nFor more complex programs, you’ll want to work in the “R Editor,” where you can write and edit multiple lines of code. When you’re ready to move beyond typing and executing commands one by one, you can use the “R Editor” window to write and manage scripts efficiently. To open a blank editor, click File → New Script from the menu. If you have an existing script, select File → Open Script to continue working on it. The image below shows a new blank “R Editor” window.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can have multiple “R Editor” windows open simultaneously, allowing you to work on different scripts side by side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe available menus and toolbar options change based on which window is currently in focus. In the image above, the focus has shifted from the “R Console” to the “R Editor,” which is why the toolbar and menu options have updated accordingly.\n\n\nAs expected, the script editor allows you to run commands either individually or in groups. You can also execute part of an expression by highlighting the code and pressing Ctrl + R (or using the “Run line or selection” button in the toolbar, or clicking Edit → Run line or selection from the menu).\n\nTo run a single line of code, place the cursor within the line you want to execute and press Ctrl + R. Note that one line may not always be a complete executable statement.\nTo run a specific section of code, highlight the desired text and press Ctrl + R. The highlighted text can span multiple lines or just part of one.\nTo run the entire script, highlight everything using Ctrl + A and then press Ctrl + R.\n\nYou can save your script anytime by pressing Ctrl + S or selecting File → Save.\nThe “R Graphics” Window:\nWhen you utilize a function such as plot() to create a graphic, the graphics window—commonly referred to as the “device”—serves as the default output area. If a graphics window is not already open, a new one is produced, otherwise the existing window is reused.\nTo illustrate this, let’s plot a graph using a built-in dataset called pressure. The dataset, which comes pre-installed with , shows the relationship between temperature (in degrees Celsius) and vapor pressure of mercury (measured in millimeters). Below, we apply the plot() function to the pressure dataset and execute it from the “R Editor”:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo open a new graphics window without closing an existing one, you can use the dev.new() function. This allows you to create multiple graphics windows for your visualizations. To save a graphic, simply click File → Save As and select your desired format from the menu.\nThe “Data Editor” Window:\nThe simplest way to examine the contents of a basic data object is by printing it directly to the Console. Just type the object’s name at the command prompt.\nTo explore the data within a data frame or matrix, you can use either fix(dataframe) or View(dataframe), where “dataframe” refers to the name of your data object. These functions are specifically for data frames and matrices. The fix() function allows you to modify the data, while View() only displays it without editing capabilities. Alternatively, you can navigate to Edit → Data Editor in the menu and specify the name of the data frame or matrix you wish to edit.\nAs an example, let’s view the pressure dataset we used earlier to plot the graph. You can use the following command:\n\nfix(pressure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will open the data frame in a tab where you can inspect it interactively.\nAny changes you make using the Data Editor are automatically saved to your workspace (you’ll learn more about saving the workspace later). However, while the Data Editor is open, you cannot run any other code, and files cannot be saved directly from this window.\nThe “R History” Window:\nYou can access your command history by using the history() function, which opens a window displaying your most recent commands. By default, this shows the last 25 lines of code you’ve submitted. Below is an example of what my current history looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save the contents of this history window, you can either click File → Save to file in the menu or use the savehistory() function directly in the Console. This allows you to preserve your previous commands for future reference or reuse.\nSaving the Workspace\n stores the data and objects you’re working with in an area of your computer’s memory called the “workspace.” While the standard R interface doesn’t have a dedicated window to display these objects, you can easily list them in the Console by using the ls() function. These objects can include data imported from external sources (such as text files), new data you’ve generated, results from expressions you’ve executed, and various other elements.\nWhen you shut down R, it will typically prompt you to save your workspace. If you choose to save it under the default name .RData (note that it’s just the file extension with no filename),  will automatically load this workspace the next time you launch it.\nFor substantial work, it’s generally considered good practice to save your raw data sources and a script that recreates your data objects. This ensures that you—or anyone else—can fully reproduce your analysis. From this perspective, it’s often unnecessary to save the workspace itself.\nHowever, if your work involves lengthy data processing or a complex script, saving the workspace can be useful as it provides a convenient starting point for your next session, saving time and effort.\nTo save your workspace, either click File → Save workspace in the menu, or use the save.image() function in the Console. If you want to save it under a specific filename, use save(file = \"filename\"). You can load a previously saved workspace by running load(file = \"filename\").\nSo far, we’ve successfully interacted with base —we’ve written our first “Hello, World!” program, performed basic arithmetic, and even plotted a graph (how cool is that?). While RGUI is functional, it can feel somewhat basic and limited compared to modern integrated development environments (IDEs), which offer enhanced features for coding, debugging, and data visualization. In the next section, we will explore the powerful capabilities provided by IDEs.\n\n\n3.2.2 RStudio IDE for  and  python\nOne of the most popular ways to interface with , beyond the basic RGUI, is through RStudio, a powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed primarily for . RStudio offers an intuitive and interactive environment, making coding, data analysis, and project management significantly easier. However, it’s important to note that before using RStudio, you must first install  on your computer.\nAccording to RStudio’s mission statement:\n\n“To create free and open-source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication. We do this to enhance the production and consumption of knowledge by everyone, regardless of economic means, and to facilitate collaboration and reproducible research, both of which are critical to the integrity and efficacy of work in science, education, government, and industry.”\n\nRStudio was founded by J.J. Allaire, a software engineer and entrepreneur, in 2009, with the first version of RStudio IDE released in 2011. Since its release, RStudio has become a go-to tool for data scientists, researchers, and statisticians worldwide.\nWhile RStudio is mainly known for its support of , it also accommodates other programming languages, such as Python, SQL, and even Stan for Bayesian statistics. This flexibility makes RStudio a multi-functional open-source IDE that is widely adopted for various programming and data analysis needs. RStudio works best with  versions 3.0.1 and higher, ensuring compatibility with most modern workflows.\n\nVisit Posit, the official RStudio website to download RStudio Desktop.\nOn the homepage, expand the \"FREE & OPEN SOURCE\" Tab and look under the \"Analyze & Explore\" section.\nClick \"RSTUDIO IDE\" (or simply select \"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO\" at the bottom of the list. If you choose \"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO\", you can skip to step 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will take you to the RStudio IDE page.\nChoose between RStudio Desktop (free) and RStudio Desktop Pro (Paid).\nOn the RStudio IDE page, you will see two editions as you scroll down the page:\n\nRStudio Desktop – Free (Open Source)\nRStudio Desktop Pro – Paid\n\nFor almost everyone—students, researchers, and individual users—the free RStudio Desktop has all the features you need for R programming.\nThe Pro version is essentially the same software but includes two additional benefits intended for organizations:\n\nA Commercial License\nSome companies cannot use software licensed under the AGPL (the license for the free version).\nThe Pro edition provides a commercial license that allows organizations to;\n\nusing RStudio in internal, closed-source, or proprietary environments\navoid releasing modified source code\ncomply with strict corporate software policies\n\nMost individual users, students, and researchers do not need this.\nAccess to Priority Support\nRStudio Desktop Pro includes:\n\ndirect support from Posit engineers\nguaranteed response times\nassistance with installation, errors, and configuration\n\nUsers of the free version still have excellent community resources such as:\n\nPosit Community\nStack Overflow\nGithub issues\nonline forums and tutorials\n\n\nGo ahead and click on \"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP\" under the Open Source Edition to get the free version of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will take you to the DOWNLOAD RStudio Desktop page\nSelect DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO On the DOWNLOAD RStudio Desktop page select DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will take you to the RStudio Desktop installers page.\nDownload the appropriate RStudio Desktop installer for your machine.\nOn the RStudio Desktop installers page, you will see a short checklist before the actual installer download links. The first item is \"1: Install \", which is a reminder that  must be installed before RStudio can be used.\n\nIf you have not yet installed , clicking this will take you to CRAN (the official  website), where you can download a precompiled binary of  for your operating system.\nIf you have already installed , you can safely ignore this step and proceed directly to downloading RStudio.\n\nFor Windows users, clicking \"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP FOR WINDOWS\" will immediately start the download of the installer (.exe file).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using macOS or Linux, simply scroll down the page to find the appropriate installer for your operating system and follow the corresponding instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the installer.\nOnce the download is complete, locate the installer file and launch it.\n\nOn Windows, double-click the .exe file.\nOn macOS, open the .dmg file and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nThis will launch the RStudio installation wizard, starting with a welcome screen similar to the one shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nProceed through the setup wizard by following the prompts. When you reach the “Choose Install Location” screen, it is strongly recommended to keep the default installation path unless you have a specific reason to change it. Click Install to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio will then begin installing the required files on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the installation completes successfully, click Finish to exit the installer. RStudio Desktop is now installed and ready to use.\nLaunch RStudio and start working\nOnce installation is complete, launch RStudio Desktop from your applications menu or desktop shortcut. There’s no need to open the base  application separately—RStudio automatically detects and uses the  installation on your system.\nAs RStudio opens, you may briefly see a start-up process similar to the one shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce RStudio opens, you’ll be greeted by it’s main interface, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this point onward, you can work entirely within RStudio. The IDE is now fully connected to , providing a more powerful and user-friendly environment for writing code, running analyses, managing projects, and creating visualizations.\n\n🎉 Congratulations!\nYou’re now fully set up and ready to start working with  using the RStudio IDE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantDo I Still Need to Download ?\n\n\n\nYes. Even if you plan to use RStudio, you must install  on your computer.\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working with R easier, but it does not include R itself. Instead, it connects to and runs the version of  installed on your system.\n\n\nBefore diving into coding, it’s worth spending a few moments customizing RStudio to enhance your experience (trust me, it makes a difference).To access the settings via Global Options, follow these steps:\n\nOn macOS, go to Tools → Global Options or simply press ⌘ + ,.\nOn Windows, head to Tools → Global Options or press Ctrl + ,.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should be greeted with the Global Options window as below.\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio offers many customization options, and over time you’ll naturally adjust them to match your personal workflow. For now, I’ll highlight just a few essential settings that are especially helpful for beginners and will set you up for a smoother experience from the start.\n\nCode Formatting (Code → Editing)\nStart by improving how your code is structured and displayed.\nIn the Code → Editing tab, enable at least the first five options, paying special attention to “Auto-indent code after paste.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis setting automatically fixes indentation when you paste code, helping your scripts stay clean and readable without extra effort. Good indentation isn’t just about aesthetics—it makes your code easier to follow, debug, and maintain, especially as your scripts grow longer or more complex.\nIf you’re just starting out, these options quietly enforce good coding habits in the background.\nCode Visibility (Code → Display)\nNext, make it easier to see where you are in your code.\nIn the Code → Display tab, consider enabling the first three options. One especially useful feature is “Highlight selected line.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis highlights the line your cursor is currently on, which is incredibly helpful when working in long scripts. It reduces eye strain and helps you avoid running or editing the wrong line by mistake.\nAppearance and Personalization (Appearance)\nFinally, customize how RStudio looks and feels.\nUnder the Appearance section, you can choose an Editor Theme, which controls the color scheme of your code editor. This is one of the most noticeable and impactful changes you can make.\nTake a moment to browse through the available themes and pick one that feels comfortable to you—there’s no “correct” choice here. Personally, I recommend trying a dark theme, especially if you code for long periods, as it can reduce eye strain. My go-to choice is Solarized Dark, but feel free to experiment and settle on what works best for your eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have selected your preferred options, click “Apply” to save the settings and apply the changes.\nThese small tweaks can make a big difference in your overall RStudio experience, giving you a smoother, more comfortable environment as you embark on your  programming journey.\n\n3.2.2.1 The RStudio Interface\nThe RStudio interface is divided into four quadrants, each serving a specific function:\n\nThe Console window,\nThe Source window,\nThe Environment | History | Connections | Tutorial window, and\nThe Files | Plots | Packages | Help | Viewer window\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you can customize the layout of the panes in the RStudio interface, I personally prefer the default arrangement. To change the pane layout, go to Tools → Global Options. Under Global Options, select the Pane Layout option and adjust the panes to your liking.\nYou may notice that sometimes the Source window isn’t visible when you first open RStudio. This happens when there’s no file opened. To activate the Source window, either open an existing file or create a new one by selecting File → New File → R Script from the menu bar, or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows or Cmd + Shift + N on macOS.\nNow, let’s briefly explore the purpose of each pane and how they contribute to your workflow in .\n\n3.2.2.1.1 The Console Window\nThe Console is normally located in the bottom-left pane of RStudio unless changed. This is where the  engine you installed separately actually runs inside RStudio. In other words, it is the same R Console you would see if you opened base R on its own, but now embedded within the RStudio interface.\nThe Console displays the output of your commands and computations, and you can also type and execute R code directly here—just as you did earlier when working with base R.\nLet’s try a quick example by calculating the sum of 20 + 7. Click into the Console, type the following, and press Enter/Return ↵ on your keyboard. The result should be straightforward:\n\n# We type this directly into the console:\n20 + 7\n\nHere’s an example of how it should appear in your RStudio Console:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the top-right corner of the Console pane, you’ll notice a broom icon. This is an important feature for clearing the Console when it gets too cluttered. If you want to remove all the text in the Console, simply click the broom icon. Alternatively, you can use the handy keyboard shortcut Ctrl + L on both Windows and Mac for the same purpose. If you prefer using code, the following commands can also clear the Console:\n\n# On Windows:\nshell(\"cls\")\n\n# or\ncat(\"\\014\") \n\n# On Linux or macOS:\nshell(\"clear\")\n\n\n\n3.2.2.1.2 The source Window\nLocated in the top-left pane of RStudio, the Source Window serves as a versatile space for managing various types of files, including data, programming code, and notes. The term “source” encompasses any file you wish to work with. The Source panel can fulfill multiple functions, such as:\n\nInspecting Data: View datasets in a spreadsheet-like (Excel-style) format, making it easier to explore and understand your data.\nWriting and Editing R Scripts: Create, open, and modify R scripts where you write code for your analyses and projects.\nWorking with Other Text-Based Files: The Source window can also open and edit a wide range of file formats, including:\n\nPlain text files (.txt)\nMarkdown files (.md)\nHTML documents (.html)\nLaTeX files (.tex)\nBibTeX files (.bib)\n\nRunning Analyses: Code written in the Source window can be executed line by line or in chunks, allowing you to run analyses, generate outputs, and build results in a structured and reproducible way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, the Source window provides a workspace for any text-based file that RStudio can read. It is where most of your coding and project development will take place, making it one of the most important components of the RStudio interface. However, it’s important to note that Microsoft Office documents and non-text files (like images) are not supported in this pane. This limitation emphasizes the focus on coding and text editing within the Source window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhy use the Source window instead of the Console?\n\n\n\nWhile you can type and run code directly in the Console, the Source window is strongly recommended for most work because it allows you to:\n\nSave your code for future use\nReproduce your analyses exactly at a later time\nOrganize your work into scripts rather than relying on temporary command\nEdit and review code before running it\n\nIn short, the Console is great for quick tests, but the Source window is where real, reusable work happens.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2.1.3 The Environment | History | Connections | Tutorial Pane\nThe top-right pane in RStudio is a multi-purpose area made up of several tabs, each designed to help you manage and understand your work more effectively.\nThe Environment tab shows all the objects currently available in your R session—that is, everything R has in memory and can work with. One of the first and most important objects you will create is a dataset, since data is central to nearly all analyses.\nAs you continue working in , this pane may also contain:\n\nDatasets\nVectors\nLists\nFunctions you define\nOther objects created during your analysis\n\nIf these terms are unfamiliar right now, don’t worry—we will introduce and explain each of them step by step in later sections. For now, it’s enough to know that the Environment pane acts like a dashboard, allowing you to quickly see what objects exist, inspect them, and manage your workspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe History tab keeps a record of the commands you have run during your current and past R sessions. This can be helpful if you want to revisit, reuse, or rerun previous code without typing it again. For example, if you computed the sum of 20 + 7, this entry will be stored in your history. You can quickly insert this command back into the console by clicking on it in the History pane and selecting To Console. This action will paste 20 + 7 back into the console, allowing you to hit Return ↵ to retrieve the result. Alternatively, you can copy the command into an existing or new R Script by clicking on To Source, enabling you to save and reuse it later. If you want to preserve your command history, you can click on the floppy disk icon to save it. Additionally, you can delete individual entries using the button with a white page and red circle, or clear the entire history using the broom icon (note that this action is irreversible).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Connections tab is used when working with external data sources such as databases or remote storage systems. Beginners may not use this tab immediately, but it becomes useful when working with larger or more complex data sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the Tutorial tab provides interactive, guided learning content. Some  packages include tutorials that appear here, making it a convenient space for hands-on learning directly within RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2.1.4 The Files | Plots | Packages | Help | Viewer | Presentation Pane\nThe bottom-right pane of RStudio is made up of five important tabs, each designed to support different aspects of your workflow; from managing files to viewing plots and accessing help.\nThe Files tab displays all files and folders within your working directory—the default location where RStudio reads from and saves files such as scripts, data, and outputs. This tab acts like a built-in file browser, allowing you to navigate your folders without leaving RStudio.\nUsing the Files pane, you can:\n\nOpen and view files\nNavigate to datasets you want to load into \nCreate, rename, or delete folders\nKeep your work neatly organized\n\nLater in this guide, we will explore R projects and working directories in more detail. For now, it’s helpful to think of the Files tab as your central navigation hub inside RStudio—keeping all the components of your work easy to find and manage in one place.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the Console is designed primarily for text input and output, it cannot display visualizations directly. Instead, RStudio offers the Plots tab, which is equivalent to the “R Graphics” window in base . This tab is specificzlly dedicated to rendering and displaying any graphs or charts you create.\nLet’s walk through a simple example. Type the following code into your Console to generate a basic boxplot (remember to press Enter/Return ↵ to run the code)\n\n# This creates a basic boxplot using the built-in 'mtcars' dataset\nboxplot(mtcars$hp)\n\nThe mtcars dataset comes pre-installed with R, making it convenient for quick demonstrations. In this example, the boxplot() function is used to visualize the distribution of the hp (horsepower) variable.Once you run the code, the resulting plot will automatically appear in the Plots tab of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can navigate through multiple plots by using the arrow buttons in this pane. To delete the current plot, click on the red circle with a white 'x', or clear all plots by using the broom icon. You can also export your plot for use in presentations or reports, with options for saving it as an image file or PDF.\nThe Packages tab is used to manage additional tools, known as packages, that extend R’s functionality. You can think of packages as apps for your phone. Each package adds new capabilities, such as creating advanced visualizations, performing machine learning analyses, or simplifying repetitive tasks.\nBy default,  comes with a set of basic packages already installed, but many analyses require additional packages that you can install as needed. The Packages pane displays a list of all packages currently installed on your system. From here, you can load or unload packages and quickly check which tools are available for your work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Help tab is your primary go-to reference when you need assistance while working in , and it also provides quick access to official documentation, manuals, learning resources, and other useful reference materials related to  and RStudio..\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Help tab also provides detailed documentation for  functions, datasets, and packages. Whenever you are unsure how a function works, what arguments it accepts, or what a dataset contains, the Help pane is usually the first place you should look.\nFor instance, if you want to explore details about the built-in mtcars dataset used earlier, simply type the following command into the Console:\n\n# Type a '?' followed by the name of a dataset/function/etc.\n# to look up helpful information about it.\n?mtcars\n\nRunning this command opens the Help tab and displays comprehensive information about the dataset, including a description, variable definitions, and usage examples.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the search bar within the Help pane to look up specific topics or browse related documentation. Beyond RStudio, there is a rich ecosystem of online resources for learning and troubleshooting. For additional learning, I highly recommend CRAN’s ‘Getting Help with R’ webpage. And if you’re ever stuck, don’t hesitate to expand your search to other resources, such as Google, Stack Overflow or Twitter (using #RStats).\nLastly, the Viewer tab is designed to display dynamic and interactive content that cannot be shown in the static Plots tab. This includes HTML-based outputs such as interactive visualizations, web dashboards (for example, Shiny apps), maps, and even entire websites generated from R. Content shown here is often interactive, allowing you to interact with your results in real-time within RStudio. If needed, these outputs can also be opened in your default web browser for a larger or more flexible viewing experience.\nClosely related is the Presentation tab, which is used when creating slide presentations directly from R using tools such as R Markdown or Quarto. When you render a presentation, the slides are displayed in this pane, allowing you to preview, navigate, and present your work without leaving RStudio. This feature is particularly useful for preparing lectures, project presentations, or research talks that combine code, results, and narrative in one reproducible workflow.\nAlthough this guide focuses mainly on static two-dimensional plots, which are commonly used in assignments, theses, and academic publications, it is useful to know that RStudio is capable of producing and displaying far more advanced and interactive outputs when your projects require them.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Working Directories and Starting your R Projects in RStudio\nOnce you have installed R and begun working with it, one of the first practical challenges you will encounter is file management (importing data or saving output). Questions such as “Where is my data located?” or “Where did R save my output?” are very common for beginners. This is where the concept of working directories and startup files becomes important.\nIn simple terms, a working directory is a folder on your computer where R looks for files to read and where it saves files by default. When R is first installed, it assigns a default working directory, which is often your home or “Documents” folder (for example, C:/Users/YourName/Documents on Windows).\nUnless you explicitly tell R otherwise, any data you load, plots you save, or files you create will be read from or written to this directory. This is why understanding and controlling your working directory is essential for organized and reproducible work.\nWhile working directories control where R reads and writes files, R also uses a small set of startup and session files to control what is loaded, remembered, or configured when a session begins.\nThese files do not replace good project organization, but they strongly influence how R behaves when it starts—what objects appear in memory, what commands are remembered, and what settings or environment variables are applied. Understanding them helps explain why R sometimes behaves differently across sessions or directories, especially for beginners.\n\n3.2.2.2.1  Startup and Session Files\nAs you begin using R, you may notice several files with names that start with a dot (.), such as:\n\n.RData\n.Rhistory\n.Rprofile\n.Renviron\n\nEach of these files can be created manually if needed. In practice, some are generated automatically as you work in R, whereas others are created only when you want to control startup behavior, environment variables, or session settings.\nLet’s look at each one in turn.\n.RData: Saving and Restoring Your Workspace\nThe .RData file stores a snapshot of your entire R workspace. This includes all objects currently in memory, such as datasets, model objects, functions, and intermediate results. R creates or updates this file only if you choose to save your workspace when exiting R or RStudio. When you restart R in the same directory, it can automatically reload everything from .RData, restoring your previous session.\nWhile convenient, automatically saving and restoring .RData can cause problems in reproducible workflows:\n\nYou may accidentally carry over outdated objects or variables from a previous session.\nScripts that rely on a clean environment may behave inconsistently.\nIt can make debugging more difficult if old objects interfere with your current analysis.\n\nFor these reasons, many experienced users often disable automatic workspace saving. Doing so ensures that each session starts clean, making your analyses more predictable and reproducible.\nHowever, there are valid scenarios where manually saving your workspace as an .RData file is very useful. For example, during computationally intensive workflows, such as training machine learning models with repeated k-fold cross-validation, results can take hours to compute. Re-running the models may also lead to slightly different results due to randomness in resampling or model initialization.\nIn such cases, saving the workspace as an .RData file allows you to:\n\nPreserve trained models, tuning results, and custom functions\nResume analysis without recomputation\nEnsure consistency when preparing tables or figures for reporting\n\nYou can manually save your workspace using:\n\nsave.image(file = \"My_Workspace.RData\")\n\nAnd later reload it with:\n\nload(\"My_Workspace.RData\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo improve reproducibility across projects, it is recommended to adjust RStudio’s default behavior:\n\nNavigate to Tools → Global Options → General\nUnder the Basic tab, uncheck the following:\n\nRestore most recently opened project at startup\nRestore previously open source documents at startup\nRestore .RData into workspace at startup\n\nUnder Workspace, set Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never.\n\nStarting each session with a clean workspace minimizes confusion and ensures that projects remain independent and reproducible. These changes aren’t mandatory—you can always adjust them later once you better understand their importance. But implementing them early can save you many headaches as you progress in R.\n\n\n.Rhistory: Tracking Console Commands\nThe .Rhistory file stores the history of all the commands you’ve entered in the R console. It allows you to recall past commands easily, making it a helpful tool for navigating through previous work. You can access your command history using the history() function or by simply scrolling through past commands using the up and down arrow keys while in the Console. Remember, in RStudio we can also access our history in the \"History\" tab under the \"Environment | History | Connections | Tutorial\" Pane.\nThat said, relying solely on .Rhistory is not recommended for serious analysis. Important code should always be saved in scripts rather than relying on command history.\n.Rprofile: Customizing R at Startup\nThe .Rprofile file allows users to customize the behavior of R everytime it starts. It is written in R code and can contain commands that automatically run when an R session begins. For example, you might use it to:\n\nSet a preferred working directory\nDefine custom options (e.g., number formatting, default stringsAsFactors behavior)\nLoad frequently used functions (though beginners are advised to avoid automatically loading packages)\n\n.Rprofile files can exist at two levels:\n\nUser-level: Located in your home directory (e.g., ~/.Rprofile). Settings here apply to all R sessions on your computer.\nProject-level: Stored in a specific project folder. Settings here only apply to R sessions started in that project.\n\nIf both user-level and project-level .Rprofile files exist, R prioritizes the project-level file. You can explicitly include the user-level .Rprofile in a project-level file using:\n\nsource(\"~/.Rprofile\")\n\nYou can create or edit your .Rprofile file conveniently in RStudio using\n\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n\nThis will open the .Rprofile file in RStudio for editing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTips for Beginners\n\nKeep your .Rprofile minimal at first. Avoid automatically loading packages until you are comfortable with R sessions and reproducibility.\nFocus on small customizations that make your workflow smoother, such as setting options or defining simple helper functions.\n\n\n\n.Renviron: Managing Environment Variables Securely\nThe .Renviron file allows you to define environment variables that are automatically loaded when R starts. Environment variables are useful for storing sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or file paths, without hard-coding them into your scripts. This helps keep your workflows secure and reproducible.\nThe .Renviron file follows a simple key-value format:\nAPI_KEY=abcd1234\nDB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword\nYou can access these variables during your R session using Sys.getenv()\n\nSys.getenv(\"API_KEY\")\n# [1] \"abcd1234\"\n\nSimilar to the .Rprofile, .Renviron files can also exist at two levels:\n\nUser-level: Located in your home directory (e.g., ~/.Renviron). Variables here are available to all R sessions.\nProject-level: Located in a specific project folder. Variables here only apply when working in that project.\n\nIf both user- and project-level files exist, R prioritizes the project-level file, unless you explicitly source the user-level file.\nTo create or edit your .Renviron file, you can use\n\nusethis::edit_r_environ()\n\nThis opens the .Renviron file in RStudio for editing, allowing you to add, modify, or remove environment variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTips for Beginners\n\nAvoid storing sensitive credentials directly in scripts. Use .Renviron instead.\nKeep your environment variables organized and documented so you and collaborators can understand them later.\nRemember to restart your R session after editing .Renviron to load changes.\n\n\n\n\nSummary Table: Common .R* Files in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nPurpose\nScope\nExample Use\n\n\n\n\n.Rprofile\nRun R code automatically at startup\nUser or project\nSet global options, define helper functions, configure project-specific behavior\n\n\n.Rhistory\nStore console command history\nPer directory/session\nRecall and reuse previously run commands\n\n\n.Renviron\nStore environment variables securely\nUser or project\nAPI keys, authentication tokens, library paths\n\n\n.RData\nSave and restore the entire R workspace\nPer directory\nPreserve trained models, analysis objects, or long-running results\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these files early in your R journey helps you avoid confusion and develop good programming habits. Not every project will require all of them, and many beginners can work comfortably for a long time without touching most of these files.\nHowever, knowing what each file does, when it is created, and how it affects your R sessions gives you greater control over your workflow. More importantly, it prepares you to understand why tools like RStudio Projects exist and how they solve many of the problems caused by unmanaged working directories and hidden session state.\n\n\n3.2.2.2.2 How Working Directories Fit Into the Bigger Picture\nNow that we understand how R manages startup behavior and session state, we return to a concept that beginners interact with constantly—the working directory. Unlike startup files, which affect how R starts, the working directory determines where R reads data from and where it writes output during your analysis as previously described.\nIn RStudio, the current working directory is shown at the top of the Console pane, making it easy to confirm at a glance. You can also check your current working directory by running the command getwd() in the console.\n\ngetwd()\n\nThis command prints the full file path of the directory R is currently using.\nIf you’re not using RStudio Projects, you must manually set the working directory at the start of every R script using the setwd() function:\n\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/Elias Nelson Kaunda/Documents/Intro-to-R\")\n\nThis tells R to use the “Intro-to-R” folder as it’s working directory. From that point onward, any files you load or save will be read from or written to this folder by default.\nFor example, when you load a dataset using read.csv(\"data.csv\"), R will look for data.csv inside the \"Intro-to-R\" directory.\nHowever, there’s a catch; setwd() uses an absolute file path, which is specific to your computer’s directory structure. If you share your script with someone else or switch to a different computer, the path will fail unless their directory structure matches yours exactly. In practice, this almost never happens (you are unlikely to have a directory structure like mine: \"C:/Users/Elias Nelson Kaunda/Documents/Intro-to-R\" on your computer).\nThis creates problems for:\n\nCollaboration\nLong-term projects\nReproducibility\nMoving between computers\n\nBecause of this, relying on setwd() is generally discouraged for serious or shared work.\nRStudio provides a solution to this problem through R Projects (files with the .Rproj extension). Using RStudio projects eliminates so much of the early-stage hassle and confusion around reading in and exporting data. When you open an R Project, RStudio automatically sets the working directory to the folder containing the project file. This removes the need to manually set the working directory and allows you to use relative paths throughout your analysis.\nRelative paths are paths that start from the project root rather than from your computers file system. This makes scripts portable, reproducible, and easy to share while collaborating with others.\nFor example, if you need to share your analysis with a colleague, you can send the entire project folder. Once your colleague opens the .Rproj file in RStudio, all scripts that rely on relative paths will work as expected, without needing to manually set or modify the working directory.\nUsing R Projects offers several key benefits:\n\nFile Organization: All files related to a project—data, scripts, figures, and reports—live in one dedicated folder. This keeps your work tidy and easier to understand.\nReproducibility: Relative paths ensure that analyses run the same way on different computers without modifying file paths.\nCollaboration: You can share the entire project folder with a colleague, who can open the .Rproj file and run your scripts immediately.\nVersion Control: R Projects integrate seamlessly with Git and GitHub, allowing you to use version control to track changes to your code over time. This is especially useful for collaboration or when you need to roll back to a previous version of your analysis.\nConvenience: RStudio automatically manages the working directory for you, reducing setup errors and mental overhead.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.2.3 Creating a New R Project in RStudio\nHere’s how you can create a new R Project in RStudio:\n\nNavigate to File → New Project from the menu bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor use the project dropdown in the top-right corner and select New Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the dialog box, choose New Directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, select New Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter a clear, descriptive name for your project folder (referred to as the Directory Name) that reflects the nature of your work. Make sure to save this project folder in a logical and organized location on your computer. You can adjust the folder’s location by clicking Browse… and selecting the appropriate directory. Ideally, this should be a folder where you routinely store your research or analysis projects, ensuring easy access and consistency in file management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, you can create a Git repository for version control by ticking the Create a git repository checkbox. If you’re unfamiliar with Git or don’t use GitHub, you can safely ignore this option for now.\nCheck the Open in new session option to open your new project in a fresh RStudio window.\nOnce you’re satisfied with the settings, click Create Project. RStudio will open a new session for your project, and you’re ready to begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce your project is set up, you’ll notice a few changes in RStudio:\n\nThe project name will appear at the top of the RStudio window.\nThe Files pane will show the root directory (i.e., your project folder), making it easy to navigate through your project files.\nThe Console will display the current file path of your project.\n\nThis setup ensures that all your scripts, data, and output are stored together in one place. While you could configure all this manually using setwd(), R Projects make the process much more intuitive and efficient.\n\n\n\n3.2.2.3 Organizing Your  Projects and Structuring Your Working Directories\nThis section is not about the technical aspects of RStudio, R, or data analysis per se. Instead, it’s about the often overlooked yet crucial habit of organizing your work through a solid folder structure. Like good coding practices, setting up a clear, logical folder structure can significantly boost your productivity and reduce frustration. A well-structured project directory will help you quickly locate files, avoid clutter, and make your work easier to share or revisit later. This is especially important when working with R projects in RStudio.\nBefore you start coding, take some time to plan your folder structure. Having dedicated folders for different file types, rather than dumping everything into one container, will save you time and prevent headaches down the line. Whether you create your folder structure within RStudio or through your file browser, the key is to be organized.\nGood folder organization also plays a critical role in reproducible research and analysis. Proper directory setup is one of the “non-code” aspects of R programming that significantly enhances your workflow, and for beginners, it should be a priority. Structuring your directories in a way that’s easy to navigate ensures that collaborators—or your future self—can follow and reproduce your work effortlessly.\nA Basic Folder Structure:\nAside from using RStudio projects, it’s also good practice to set up a working directory that makes your project easy to navigate. Here’s a basic template you can use as a starting point:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each project I work on, I usually have at least the following folder structure:\n\nData: This folder contains all the files you’ll need to import into R for analysis or visualization. These could include CSV, Excel, SPSS (*.sav), .FST, .RDS, .tif, .shp, or .gpkg files, depending on your work. It’s a good idea to create two separate subfolders: one for raw data (untouched, as collected or downloaded) and another for processed or cleaned data (after some wrangling and transformation in R). This ensures that you keep your original data intact while also organizing the processed data outputs.\nR Scripts: Here, you save all your R scripts. This includes your analysis code as well as any custom functions you may write. You might consider creating a subfolder specifically for your functions if you find it convenient to keep them separate. Saving your scripts and functions this way allows for easy re-use across different analyses and projects. Rather than creating separate projects for every analysis, you can store multiple scripts in one project folder—making it easier to manage different tasks on the same dataset.\nOutput: Use this folder to store all the outputs generated from your scripts, such as plots, reports (e.g., HTML or PDF), and any data exports. This folder helps differentiate between input data and the final results, ensuring others (or you, in the future) can easily identify the outputs of your analysis.\n\nIn RStudio, your directory structure might look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis template should serve as a good starting point if you’re new to project organization. However, remember that each project has its unique requirements. You should always adapt the directory structure to fit the specific needs of the project while maintaining a level of consistency that simplifies collaboration and future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s also a good practice to use lowercase for folder names, as shown in the example above. This makes it easier when you reference folder names in your code for reading or writing files, reducing potential errors related to case sensitivity.\n\n\nBy adopting this structure early on, you’ll streamline your workflow, improve the reproducibility of your work, and make it easier to share or revisit your projects with confidence.\n\n\n3.2.2.4 Writing  Scripts in RStudio\nCode quickly becomes long and complex. Thus, it is not very convenient to write it in the console. So, instead, we can write code into an R Script. Remember the “R Editor” window we encountered in the base RGUI—well the R Script in RStudio could be considered as it’s equivalent, but much better. An R Script is a document that RStudio recognizes as R programming code. Files that are not R Scripts, like .txt, .rtf or .md, can also be opened in RStudio, but any code written in it will not be automatically recognized.\nWhen opening an R script or creating a new one, it will display in the “Source“ window. Some refer to this window as the ‘script editor’. An R script starts as an empty file. Good coding etiquette, demands that we use the first line to indicate what this file does by using a comment ‘#’.\nPerhaps one of the most important aspects of making your code comprehensible for others and your future self is adding comments about why you did something. You can write comments directly in your script, and tell R not no execute those words simply by putting a hashtag (#) before you start typing the comment.\nComments can be used to explain R code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.\nComments starts with a #. When executing code, R will ignore anything that starts with #.🔥\nBelow are examples of how you can use comments in R’s syntax:\n\n# Load dplyr package\n1library(dplyr)\n\nmtcars_summary &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  filter(cyl == 6) %&gt;% \n  select(mpg, hp, wt) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n2    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),\n    avg_hp = mean(hp),\n    avg_wt = mean(wt)\n  )\n\n\n1\n\ndplyr is one of the cornerstone of the tidyverse, really useful for data wrangling.\n\n2\n\nhere I’m computing 3 variables, the averages of mpg, hp and wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover over the circled numbers for additional context.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n# Create a boxplot to visualize miles per gallon (mpg) by the number of cylinders (cyl)\n\n# Load the built-in 'mtcars' dataset\n# This dataset provides information on various car models and their specifications\nhead(mtcars)  # Display the first few rows to understand the structure of the dataset\n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n# Create a boxplot using base R functions\n# Group the 'mpg' variable by the 'cyl' variable (number of cylinders)\nboxplot(mpg ~ cyl,            # Formula notation indicating mpg by cyl\n        data = mtcars,       # Specify the dataset\n        main = \"Miles per Gallon by Number of Cylinders\",  # Title of the plot\n        xlab = \"Number of Cylinders\",  # Label for the x-axis\n        ylab = \"Miles per Gallon\",     # Label for the y-axis\n        col = c(\"#FF5733\", \"#6A0DAD\", \"#3BB143\"),  # Colors for each box\n        border = \"grey20\")  # Border color of the boxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Comments like these help explain what each part of the code does and why it is used.\n# Always include comments in your R scripts for better readability and understanding.\n\nAll examples in this post can easily be copied and pasted into your own R script. Let’s try it with the following code. The plot this code creates reveals which car manufacturer produces the most efficient cars. Copy and paste this code into your R script.\n\n\n3.2.2.5 Updating  and RStudio: Staying on the Cutting Edge\nWhile regularly updating your software might not directly improve your programming skills, it can certainly save you from unnecessary frustration down the road. It’s important to remember that R and RStudio are separate programs, meaning you need to update them individually. Although they work closely together, updating RStudio won’t automatically update R itself, and vice versa.\nThis distinction becomes crucial when certain tools or packages you’ve installed through RStudio require the latest version of R. For instance, if you’re using a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm that’s incompatible with older versions of R, you might run into errors or performance issues. Likewise, R packages developed by the community (which we’ll explore later) also need to be updated independently—they are not automatically refreshed when you update R or RStudio.\nNow, I know this sounds a bit tedious, but don’t worry—it’s simpler than it seems. Updating packages within RStudio is straightforward, and I’ll guide you through it. Just keep in mind: R, RStudio, and your packages all need to be updated separately.\nBy staying on top of updates, you’ll ensure that your coding environment remains compatible, efficient, and equipped with the latest features, sparing you the hassle of unexpected errors or incompatibility down the line.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 VS Code: IDE and Code Editor for Software Developers and Programming\nRStudio is often the preferred IDE for running R code, given its robust features and intuitive workflow. However, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has rapidly gained traction as a versatile code editor across a multitude of languages. Speaking from personal experience—and perhaps echoing the sentiment of others in the R and broader programming communities—using R in VS Code often starts as an experiment to find an all-in-one code editor. The idea of managing all programming tasks within a single environment is appealing, and VS Code offers just that.\nHaving used VS Code extensively for Python, HTML, CSS, Jupyter notebooks, and more, I found it natural to explore its potential for running R code. The convenience of consolidating various languages into one editor was persuasive, and it became clear why others might also seek this seamless experience.\nVisual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful and flexible code editor that supports the R programming language through the R extension. This extension provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, linting, and more.\nSetting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for R isn’t as straightforward as installing RStudio. This is mainly because VS Code is designed to support a vast range of programming languages, while RStudio is specifically tailored for R. Including built-in support for all of VS Code’s potential languages would make it overly complex and resource-heavy. Instead, VS Code takes a modular approach, allowing users to customize their setup by installing specific extensions that cater to their unique programming needs. This flexibility is powerful, but it does mean that configuring VS Code for R requires a few additional steps compared to the streamlined experience of RStudio.\nTo run R in VSCode, as with RStudio, you first need to have R (version 3.4.0 or later) installed on your machine. I recommend installing R using a precompiled binary for simplicity, though building from source is also an option, as discussed previously. Since we’ve already discussed the steps for installing R on windows and MacOS we skip all of this and proceed to show how to install VScode and configuring it to run R.\n\n3.2.3.1 Setting Up R Packages for VS Code Integration\nAfter installing R, you’ll need to install certain R packages from CRAN to enable seamless integration with VS Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Packages\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the details, let me give you a brief overview of R packages. Think of this as a quick primer to get you familiar with them. In essence, packages in R are collections of R functions, compiled code, and sample data organized in a standard structure. They are fundamental units of reproducible R code and greatly enhance the capabilities of your R environment. A package is essentially a toolkit, containing functions, data, and documentation that extend the base R installation, which itself includes many essential packages that you’ll use frequently. As your projects become more diverse, you’ll inevitably reach a point where you need additional packages to perform specialized tasks.\n\n\nTo install packages from CRAN, you use the install.packages() function. For integrating R with VS Code, you will need to install the following packages:\n\n# For R syntax highlighting and code completion\ninstall.packages(\"languageserver\")\n\n# For enhanced plot outputs in VS Code\ninstall.packages(\"httpgd\")\n\nThese packages are crucial for creating a smooth development experience when working with R in VS Code. The languageserver package provides language features like code completion and diagnostics, while httpgd enables better handling of plot outputs, making your workflow more efficient and visually appealing.\nIn the next sections, we’ll explore the essential steps for setting up VS Code for R development, including installing extensions and configuring your environment for optimal use.\n\n\n3.2.3.2 Installing and integrating VSCode with \n\nStep one, obviously, is downloading Visual Studio Code, which you can find on the Visual Studio Code website.\nVS Code is free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Install it like any other software package.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Positron: A New, Yet Familiar IDE for  and  python"

We’ve also covered why it is important to organize your code into  scripts for reproducibility. Here we use most of what we’ve already learnt while learning more.\nAs discussed earlier the most basic computations you can perform in  are arithmetic operations. Let’s take a look at a few more examples:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nClick Run Code to execute the examples.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nMost of these arithmetic operations are fairly straightforward except for the extraction of roots instead of the root symbol, to compute square root in , we have to use the sqrt() function.\nNow in your IDE for example RStudio you can enter all these operations in an  script and with your cursor click Run or simply use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Enter. This tells  to evaluate each operation and give us the output just as above in your Console."
